# Coding-Challenges
I would like to try out solutions to coding challenges I came across. Please let me know if you see better approch to same problem
1) Find 2 numbers from given array whose sum equals the target
  e.g. Input -> Target = 11 , array = [1,3,7,9,2]
       Output -> positions 3,4 (for numbers 9 and 2. Sum of 9 and 2 is 11)
2) Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
3) Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.
